# Data Analyst Portfolio - Milette Mae Antonio
## About me
###
Hi, I'm Milette! I'm a chemical engineer with a strong passion for transitioning into a data analyst role. I have a year of experience as a process engineer in a nanofiber company, where I honed my skills in analyzing data, identifying patterns, and conducting experiments to meet project and customer requirements. This experience strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills, enhanced my ability to interpret data-driven insights, learned how to design experiments and effectively communicate results which are essential skills for a data analyst.

This experience ignited my interest in using data analysis to drive decision-making and address complex problems. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, experimenting with them to solve practical challenges, and continuously expanding my knowledge in this field. I thrive on the excitement of uncovering meaningful insights from data and the satisfaction of applying those insights to solve real-world problems.

## About me
###
Hi, I'm Milette! I'm a chemical engineer with a strong passion for transitioning into a data analyst role. I have a year of experience as a process engineer in a nanofiber company, where I honed my skills in analyzing data, identifying patterns, and conducting experiments to meet project and customer requirements. This experience strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills, enhanced my ability to interpret data-driven insights, learned how to design experiments and effectively communicate results which are essential skills for a data analyst.

This experience ignited my interest in using data analysis to drive decision-making and address complex problems. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, experimenting with them to solve practical challenges, and continuously expanding my knowledge in this field. I thrive on the excitement of uncovering meaningful insights from data and the satisfaction of applying those insights to solve real-world problems.

## Objective
###
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills through various projects using data analysis tools and provide solution to problems.

## Projects
  ### DataCo Global Supply Chain
  **`Description:`** The dataset from DataCo Global contains data in supply chain operations from 2015 to 1st quarter 2018. The main objective for this project is to analyze the performance of supply chain logistics and sales. Key findings include a low order fill rate of 42.79% throughout the years and consistent late deliveries from the shipping operations, particularly with the standard shipping mode. Furthermore, the fan shop department was the top performer, contributing to nearly 50% of sales annually with the fishing category leading in sales.
  
**`Tools:`** MS Excel & Power BI

**`Skills:`** Data Wrangling, Data Visulization
